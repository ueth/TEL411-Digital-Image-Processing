# TEL411 - Digital Image Processing

This repository is a comprehensive collection of coursework for the TEL411 Digital Image Processing course. It comprises a series of MATLAB scripts designed to explore and elucidate various image processing tasks, supplemented by relevant resources such as images and assignment instructions.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Introduction to Image Processing

Located in the `THL411_exercise_1` directory, this exercise serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts of image processing. It provides a hands-on experience with basic image manipulation techniques, including reading and displaying an image, adjusting brightness, and stretching contrast. These foundational skills form the basis for more complex image processing tasks.

### Exercise 2: Advanced Image Processing Techniques

Housed in the `THL411_exercise_2` directory, this exercise delves into more intricate image processing techniques. It includes scripts that compute the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of an image, providing a deeper understanding of image characteristics. Additionally, it introduces the concept of image histograms, a graphical representation of the tonal distribution in a digital image.

### Exercise 3: Image Filtering and Convolution

Situated in the `THL411_exercise_3` directory, this exercise focuses on the critical area of image filtering and convolution. It includes a script that performs convolution of an image with a filter, a fundamental operation in many image processing tasks. This exercise provides a practical understanding of how filters can be used to modify images, for example, to remove noise or to extract edges.

### Exercise 4: Image Segmentation

Found in the `THL411_exercise_4` directory, this exercise explores the complex topic of image segmentation. Image segmentation is a crucial step in many image processing and computer vision tasks, as it involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or "regions of interest". The scripts included in this exercise demonstrate how to segment an image into different regions based on pixel intensity, providing a practical understanding of this vital image processing technique.
